         <h1 class="subtitles text-center"> (Updated: 2021-05-08) by Kirsten Pevidal </h1>
         <h2 class = headingz>
         Context
         <h2>
         <p class="for_desc_proj">
           In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share oering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that
            are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
            returned to any other station in the system anytime.
            <br><br>
            Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One
            approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and
            annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who
            purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
            <br><br>
            Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the
            pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be
            key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very
            good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and
            have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.
            <br><br>
            Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do
            that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders dier, why casual
            riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could aect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in
            analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

         The Dataset

         <p class="for_desc_proj">
           You will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends.
           Download the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data here.
           (Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the
           datasets are appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by Motivate
           International Inc. under this license.) T
           <br><br>
           This is public data that you can use to explore how different customer types are using
           Cyclistic bikes. But note that data-privacy issues prohibit you from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means
           that you won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service
           area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.

         Data Cleaning

         These are the data cleaning techniques I used to produce the cleaned the dataset.
           <ul class="for_desc_bullet">
           <li>Perform Data Cleaning Using Rstudio</li>
           <li>Rename columns for consistency and to make them easier to understand.</li>
           <li>Make sure all values are unique, removing duplicate values if necessary.</li>
           <li>Merge all data frames into one whole dataframe</li>
           <li>Make sure dataframe is consistent and clean</li>
           <li>I use Rstudio and I use tidyverse lubridate & ggplot</li>
           <li>Make sure the Member_casual column only has two values: member or casual, so we reassign cells to desired values.</li>
           <li>Create ride_length column as well as date,year,month columns for additional opportunities to aggregate data</li>
           <li>Make sure columns are in the correct data type so you can stack them together later.</li>
           <li>Remove unwanted columns.</li>
           <li>Create Csv file of summary of analysis</li>

         The Analysis
         <h2>
         <p class="for_desc_proj">
         Overall, there are more annual members ride than casual users ride (1.9million vs. 1.3million). </p>
         <img src="img/project_image/Cyclistic/number_of_rides.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-thumbnail" alt="Responsive image">
         <p class="for_desc_proj">There are more casual user rides in the weekend and more member rides in the weekday. There is nothing really important to deduce in this information.</p>
         <img src="img/project_image/Cyclistic/daily_total_rides.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-thumbnail" alt="Responsive image">
         <p class="for_desc_proj">
         However, looking at the duration per day of the week, an emerging trend can be seen. We can see that casual riders use Cyclistic bikes longer than the annual members.
         </p>
         <img src="img/project_image/Cyclistic/daily_avg_ride_length.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-thumbnail" alt="Responsive image">
         <p class="for_desc_proj">
         This pattern can be even seen by looking at the monthly average ride duration.
         </p>
         <img src="img/project_image/Cyclistic/monthly_avg_ride_length.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-thumbnail" alt="Responsive image">
         <p class="for_desc_proj">
         Another important thing I notice is the pattern I see at the monthly total rides. There is a very noticeable spike around July until Spetember, during summer.
         </p>

         Final Thoughts
         <h2>
         <p class="for_desc_proj">
         All things considered, I managed to come up with three effective and efficient suggestions that may help Cyclistic convert casual users into annual memberships.
         <br><br>Create reward system based on ride durations for annual members.

         <br>Limit rental duration for casual users.

         <br> Create annual membership promotion during peak season. (Seasonal promotion)

         I also think that doing further studies and exploration in the following topics will help Cyclistic develop more effective methods in converting users.
         <br><br>1) How can we utilize our different rideable bikes(Classic bike, E-bike) to attract users?
         2) Number of one-day/two-day passes purchased by casual users.
         3) What can we do to attract casual users living near Cyclistic bike users to get annual passes?
