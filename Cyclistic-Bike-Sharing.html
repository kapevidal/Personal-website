         <h1 class="titles text-center"> Cyclistic Bike Sharing </h1>
         <h1 class="subtitles text-center"> (Updated: 2021-05-08) by Kirsten Pevidal </h1>
         <h2 class = headingz>
         Context
         <h2>
         <p class="for_desc_proj">
            This case study focus on a fictional bike-sharing company, Cyclistic. In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share platform.
            Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who cannot use a standard two-wheeled bike.
            Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.
            <br><br>
            For this case study, I will be working with the director of marketing as my supervisor.
            Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.
            Cyclistic relies in the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.
            <a class="font-weight-bold">Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders and customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.</a>
            <br><br>
            Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.
            So, the supervisor believes that maximizing annual members count will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign for all-new customers,
            the supervisor see converting casual riders into members as an alternative. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and
            have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.
            <br><br>
            The supervisor has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do
            that, the marketing analyst team will need to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ. The supervisor and her team are interested in
            analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends - enter, me.
         </p>

            Business Task
         <h2>
         <p class="for_desc_proj">
            I will deal with the question "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?".
            <br><br>Then, I will need to present three recommendations based on my analysis to the notoriously detail-oriented Cyclistic executive team who will be responsible to the approval of the recommendations.
         </p>
         <h2 class = headingz>
         The Dataset
         <h2>
         <p class="for_desc_proj">
           I will use <a class="font-weight-bold">Cyclistic’s previous 12 months trip datasets</a> to analyze and identify trends.
           <br>(Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the
           datasets are appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by Motivate
           International Inc. under this <a href="https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement">license</a>.)
           <br><br>
           <a class="font-weight-bold">Limitations:</a> data-privacy issues prohibits analysts from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means
           that I will not able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service
           area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.

           <br><br> Below are the columns that will be included in the datasets I will focus on for my analysis:
         <ul class="for_desc_bullet">
            <li>Ride ID</li>
            <li>Rideable Type (Bike Type)</li>
            <li>Trip Duration (Ride Length)</li>
            <li>Member Type</li>
            <li> Date (day, month, year) - these columns will be created to allow aggregations </li>
         </ul>
         </p>
         <h2 class = headingz>
         Data Cleaning
         <h2>
         <p class="for_desc_proj">
         I will use 12 separated csv files that represent each previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data. I decided to combine these separated files into one, so I made sure that consistency in columns and data types are present in all separate datasets.
         <br> Each dataset contains at least 200,000 rows, which means I am dealing with big data for this analysis. I initially decided to use SQL, but I experienced difficulty in importing large file sizes. Alternatively, I used RStudio for the most part of the case study.

         <br><br>The data cleaning process is listed in chronological order:
           <ul class="for_desc_bullet">
           <li>I decided to use tidyverse(), libridate(), & ggplot()</li>
           <ul class="for_desc_bullet">
           <li>Tidyverse() - to wrangle data</li>
           <li>Libridate() - to deal with data attributes</li>
           <li>ggplot() - to visualize data</li>
           </ul>
           <li>I planned to use rename(), unique(), and mutate(), but The column naming and column data types are arleady consistent and there are no duplicates. </li>
           <li>I binded the separated dataset into one dataframe using bind_row()</li>
           <li>I drop unwanted columns using select(-c('unwanted columns here'))</li>
           <li>I made sure the Member_casual column only has two values: member or casual, so I reassigned cells to desired values using mutate().</li>
           <li>I created ride_length column as well as date,year,month columns for additional opportunities to aggregate data</li>
           <li>The dataframe still includes a few hundred entries when bikes were taken out of docks and checked for quality or ride_length was negative, So I removed them.</li>
           <li>I saved and created the cleaned dataset as a CSV file for analysis analysis using write.csv()</li>
           </ul>
         </p>

         The Analysis
         <h2>
         <p class="for_desc_proj">
         Majority of the data analysis were done in RStudio, although I used Tableau for some of the data visualization.
         I decided that I will focus my analysis in ride length by day of week and by month. I also included focusing in montlhy total rides.

         <br><br> After visualizing our cleaned dataset and removing noisy data, I first verified there are more annual members total rides than casual users rides (1.9million vs. 1.3million). It is pretty interesting to see how strong the bike-sharing program is to casuals. </p>
         <img src="img/project_image/Cyclistic/number_of_rides.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-thumbnail" alt="Responsive image">
         <p class="for_desc_proj">Diving deeper, we will see that there are more casual user rides in the weekend and more member rides in the weekday. It is likely that annual members uses bikes to go to their work although Cyclistic bikes are usually used for leisure. There is nothing really impactful that I noticed but I thought of an interesting topic for further exploration which I will discuss later.</p>
         <img src="img/project_image/Cyclistic/daily_total_rides.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-thumbnail" alt="Responsive image">
         <p class="for_desc_proj">
         Things start to look more interesting after looking at how users' ride duration use of Cyclistic bikes differ.
         Looking at the duration per day of the week, an emerging trend can be seen.
         We can see that casual riders use Cyclistic bikes longer than the annual members.
         I thought that this can support the idea of implementing
         some sort of system or program that will reward users based on how much and how long they use Cyclistic bikes.
         I deduced that including this incentive-like program to the annual membership package will make it more appealing to casual users to try out annual membership passes.
         </p>
         <img src="img/project_image/Cyclistic/daily_avg_ride_length.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-thumbnail" alt="Responsive image">
         <p class="for_desc_proj">
         This pattern can be even seen by looking at the monthly average ride duration.
         </p>
         <img src="img/project_image/Cyclistic/monthly_avg_ride_length.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-thumbnail" alt="Responsive image">
         <p class="for_desc_proj">
         Another important thing I notice is the pattern I see at the monthly total rides. There is a very noticeable spike around July until September, during summer.

         Final Thoughts
         <h2>
         <p class="for_desc_proj">
         All things considered, I managed to come up with three effective and efficient suggestions that may help Cyclistic convert casual users into annual memberships.
         <br><br>Create reward system based on ride durations for annual members.

         <br>Limit rental duration for casual users.

         <br> Create annual membership promotion during peak season. (Seasonal promotion)

         I also think that doing further studies and exploration in the following topics will help Cyclistic develop more effective methods in converting users.
         <br><br>1) How can we utilize our different rideable bikes(Classic bike, E-bike) to attract users?
         2) Number of one-day/two-day passes purchased by casual users.
         3) What can we do to attract casual users living near Cyclistic bike users to get annual passes?
